todo:
- test real data 40 polygons, k = 6, coplanarity = 0.5 - inexact intersections (hybrid mode?)
- test real data 40 polygons, k = 1, coplanarity = 0.1 - inexact intersections (hybrid mode?)
- exact kernel: check all tests + random tests
- add hybrid mode
- add random perturbations at the preprocessing step
- try to avoid all inexact computations such as sqrt e.g.
- try to find out where we lose the precison the most
- run a random config and if fails call back and run on a different config until success
- try to avoid errors by using a smaller step
- make intersections a part of kinetic traits that is exact
- check new stress-test-6 files
- fix EPECK errors
